<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Joe Graham, I&rsquo;m a 2019 graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology with a BS/MS in Computing Security.
I&rsquo;ve worked with organizations in both the private and public sector performing jobs ranging from systems administration to cybersecurity research in multiple domains, and I currently work as a cybersecurity analyst in the public sector.
My main cybersecurity interests lie in penetration testing and offensive security.</p>
<p>During my time at RIT, I was active within the university&rsquo;s various cybersecurity organizations: <a href="https://ritsec.club">RITSEC</a> (formerly the RIT Cybersecurity Club and the Security Practices and Research Student Association), and the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition team as a competitor and as an assistant coach.
I helped run the Information Security Talent Search from 2017-2019 as the networking lead, and participated in RITSEC&rsquo;s red team focusing on network device exploitation for the same time period. In addition to these competitions, I obtained the Offensive Security Certified Professional certification in December 2016.</p>
<p>Since graduating from college, I have also assisted with the 2021 Northeastern CCDC competition hosted at RIT. I mainly
focused on configuring and customizing the scoring engine, which that year was <a href="https://github.com/scorestack/scorestack">scorestack</a>.</p>
