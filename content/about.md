# Joe Graham
Hello! I'm Joe Graham, I'm a 2019 graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology with a BS/MS in Computing Security. 
I've worked with organizations in both the private and public sector performing jobs ranging from systems administration to cybersecurity research in multiple domains, and I currently work as a cybersecurity analyst in the public sector.
My main cybersecurity interests lie in penetration testing and offensive security.

During my time at RIT, I was active within the university's various cybersecurity organizations: [RITSEC](https://ritsec.club) (formerly the RIT Cybersecurity Club and the Security Practices and Research Student Association), and the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition team as a competitor and as an assistant coach. 
I helped run the Information Security Talent Search from 2017-2019 as the networking lead, and participated in RITSEC's red team focusing on network device exploitation for the same time period. In addition to these competitions, I obtained the Offensive Security Certified Professional certification in December 2016.

Since graduating from college, I have also assisted with the 2021 Northeastern CCDC competition hosted at RIT. I mainly
focused on configuring and customizing the scoring engine, which that year was [scorestack](https://github.com/scorestack/scorestack).
