      <description>Networked is a Linux box created by Guly that is rated fairly easily by the HTB community. Even though it was fairly easy, I got some good practice with command injection vulnerabilities and circumventing file verification methods.
Enumeration Let&amp;rsquo;s start by taking a look at what services are running on the box using nmap.
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-08-30 16:16 EDT Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.146 Host is up (0.</description>

      <title>Hack The Box Write-up: Bastion</title>

      <description>This is my first in a series of write-ups on systems I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully exploited on HackTheBox. Bastion is a Windows host that at the time of writing has been rated fairly easy by other hackers, which was my experience as well. However, this system was still a fun system to exploit with a novel way of getting user access.
Enumeration First things first, let&amp;rsquo;s nmap the box to see what services the box has running.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year I was helping RIT&amp;rsquo;s Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) team prepare to compete at the national competition by looking into possible attack vectors that the red team would be using to exploit the team&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure and how to defend against those attacks. Nick O&amp;rsquo;Brien and I decided to look into the Palo Alto Networks virtual firewall product to find potential pain points for the team, as PAN has been a sponsor for the competition for the last few years and has frequently provided equipment and VMs to teams for use during the competition.</description>
