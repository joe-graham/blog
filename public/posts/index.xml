      <description>iClean is a Linux box created by LazyTitan33 that is rated medium by the HTB community. iClean&amp;rsquo;s exploit process involves exploiting a web application vulnerable to blind cross-site scripting (XSS), server-side template injection (SSTI), and then privilege escalation via an arbitrary write as root vulnerability in the sudo configuration.&#xA;Enumeration As usual, we start by enumerating the open ports and services on the system.&#xA;# Nmap 7.94SVN scan initiated Mon Apr 15 12:07:52 2024 as: nmap -p- -sV -oA 10.</description>

      <title>Porting an Exploit for CVE-2016-6366</title>

      <description>A few years ago I wrote a blog post for a class I was taking in school exploring the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance and trying to port the exploit to a known vulnerable version of the firmware that did not yet have an exploit written for it. As you can see from how the post ends, I ran out of time that semester and was unable to finish the exploit.</description>

      <description>Networked is a Linux box created by Guly that is rated fairly easily by the HTB community. Even though it was fairly easy, I got some good practice with command injection vulnerabilities and circumventing file verification methods.&#xA;Enumeration Let&amp;rsquo;s start by taking a look at what services are running on the box using nmap.&#xA;Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-08-30 16:16 EDT Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.146 Host is up (0.</description>

      <title>Hack The Box Write-up: Bastion</title>

      <description>This is my first in a series of write-ups on systems I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully exploited on HackTheBox. Bastion is a Windows host that at the time of writing has been rated fairly easy by other hackers, which was my experience as well. However, this system was still a fun system to exploit with a novel way of getting user access.&#xA;Enumeration First things first, let&amp;rsquo;s nmap the box to see what services the box has running.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-1576: PAN-OS Command Injection/Shell Escape</title>

      <description>Earlier this year I was helping RIT&amp;rsquo;s Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) team prepare to compete at the national competition by looking into possible attack vectors that the red team would be using to exploit the team&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure and how to defend against those attacks. Nick O&amp;rsquo;Brien and I decided to look into the Palo Alto Networks virtual firewall product to find potential pain points for the team, as PAN has been a sponsor for the competition for the last few years and has frequently provided equipment and VMs to teams for use during the competition.</description>

      <description>Hello! My name is Joe Graham, and welcome to my blog! I am a cybersecurity professional who specializes in penetration testing and offensive security. I plan to include things like HackTheBox write-ups and posts about penetration testing or participating in bug bounties/vulnerability disclosure. Thanks for visiting!</description>
